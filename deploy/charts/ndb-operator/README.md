## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes v1.23.0+

## Install the Chart

The `helm install` command can be used to create the NdbCluster CRD, deploy the NDB Operator and the webhook server to the Kubernetes Cluster.
The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the configurable options provided by the helm chart.

### Install from helm repo

The NDB Operator helm repository is hosted at `https://mysql.github.io/mysql-ndb-operator/`.

To add the chart repository :

```bash
helm repo add ndb-operator-repo https://mysql.github.io/mysql-ndb-operator/
helm repo update
```

To install the chart with the release name `ndbop`:

```bash
helm install \
  --namespace=ndb-operator --create-namespace \
  ndbop ndb-operator-repo/ndb-operator
```

### Install from source code

To install the chart from the source code, with the release name `ndbop`:

```bash
helm install \
  --namespace=ndb-operator --create-namespace \
  ndbop deploy/charts/ndb-operator
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `ndbop` release :

```bash
helm uninstall --namespace=ndb-operator ndbop
```
The command `helm uninstall` removes only the NDB Operator deployment and the webhook server deployment. The NdbCluster CRD will not be deleted by this command.

To delete the CRD from the Kubernetes cluster :

```bash
kubectl delete customresourcedefinitions ndbclusters.mysql.oracle.com
```
Note that removing the NdbCluster CRD will also stop and delete any MySQL Cluster pods started by the NDB Operator.

## Configuration

The following table has the configurable options supported by the chart and their defaults.

| Parameter             | Description                         | Default                     |
| ----------------------| ------------------------------------| ----------------------------|
| `image`               | NDB Operator image name with tag    | `container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-ndb-operator:8.0.44-1.0.13` |
| `imagePullPolicy`     | NDB Operator image pull policy      | `IfNotPresent`              |
| `imagePullSecretName` | NDB Operator image pull secret name |                             |
| `clusterScoped`       | Scope of the Ndb Operator.<br>If `true`, the operator is cluster-scoped and will watch for changes to any NdbCluster resource across all namespaces.<br>If `false`, the operator is namespace-scoped and will only watch for changes in the namespace it is released into. | `true`|

These options can be set using the 'â€“set' argument of the helm CLI.

For example, to specify a custom imagePullPolicy,
```bash
helm install --set imagePullPolicy=Always ndbop deploy/charts/ndb-operator
```
