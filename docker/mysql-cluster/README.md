## Build MySQL Cluster docker image

Ndb operator uses the public images available in Oracle Container Registry. By default, the `container-registry.oracle.com/mysql/community-cluster:8.4.6` image is used. A custom MySQL Cluster image can also be built and used with the operator. The docker files and scripts required for building a MySQL Cluster image are included in this directory.

```sh
# SRCDIR is the location of the MySQL Cluster Source
# TMPDIR is the location in which the MySQL Cluster will be built
# IMAGE_TAG is the string to be tagged to the container image being built
SRCDIR=/path/to/mysql/cluster/source TMPDIR=/build/dir IMAGE_TAG=<custom-tag> build.sh
```
